*Chen Tessler, Yunrong Guo, Ofir Nabati, Gal Chechik, Xue Bin Peng*

**ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 (TOG)**

A unified physics-based controller that formulates character control as motion inpainting. 
Supports diverse control modalities including sparse keyframes, text instructions, and scene 
information through a single model trained on masked motion descriptions.

*Chen Tessler, Yifeng Jiang, Erwin Coumans, Zhengyi Luo, Gal Chechik, Xue Bin Peng*

**ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2025**

A generative control policy for full-body object manipulation, enabling users to specify 
high-level objectives such as target object poses or body poses. Supports teleoperation, 
object goals, and generative behavior from a single unified controller.
